## About zkBlock

zkBlock is a decentralized game that gives players the opportunity to earn in-game resources—coins and diamonds—through a series of mini-games. These resources can then be used to build and customize unique worlds. Players can mint their worlds as NFTs and sell them in the zkBlock marketplace, creating a player-driven economy that is fun, rewarding, and scalable.

## How it Works

1. **🎮 Enter the Game Center**  
   Players start by entering the Game Center, where they can engage in various mini-games to win **💰 coins** and **💎 diamonds**.

2. **🏗️ Build Your World**  
   Using **💰 coins** to buy blocks and **💎 diamonds** to acquire land, players can construct their own unique worlds, limited only by their creativity.

3. **🛒 Sell Your Creation**  
   Once their world is complete, players can mint it as an **🖼️ NFT** and list it for sale in the **🏪 marketplace**, where other players can explore, buy, or trade worlds.

4. **🔑 Ownership and Profit**  
   By converting creations into NFTs, zkBlock players have full ownership of their assets and the opportunity to **💵 earn real-world value** from their gameplay.
