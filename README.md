## Bounties Covered for the Hackathon

As part of the hackathon, zkBlock integrates the following platforms and protocols:

1. **Mantle:**  
   Mantle is utilized for zkBlock’s data availability and computation layer, allowing for efficient scaling and transaction throughput. By building on Mantle, zkBlock can process a high volume of transactions, making it ideal for the large user base and in-game transactions.

2. **Ore Protocol:**  
   Ore Protocol enables zkBlock’s identity layer, ensuring that all users have secure, decentralized identities. This helps zkBlock with user management, verification, and secure authentication, providing a seamless login and interaction experience.

3. **Scroll:**  
   Scroll powers zkBlock’s zk-rollups, offering efficient and low-cost transactions. This allows zkBlock to operate with near-zero fees while maintaining the security of Ethereum's mainnet, ensuring that NFT minting and marketplace transactions are scalable and cost-effective.
